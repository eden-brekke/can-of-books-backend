# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Logistical
* What hours will you be available to communicate?

* What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  * Slack 
* How often will you take breaks?
  * Whenever one or the other feels like it, at least 10 minutes every hour
* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  * Work Harder, call in the big guns 


## Cooperative
* Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
  Tai: Color theory, UI Design, Bug tracing
  Eden: Time management, Stubborn(work hard to get stuff done)
* How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  * Tai : While reviewing code, and offering input while developing the front end 
  * Eden : Good at finding examples of what we're doing pretty easily, ensure stuff gets done
* In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  * Eden : get better at being more flexible in my coding style 
  * Tai : get better with working with unfamiliar code bases, using carousels! 
* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  * Ask questions as they arise, explain until the other understands. 

## Conflict Resolution
* What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  * Hunt the other person down, connect with a third party mediator(TA, or Instructor) and work things out through them. 
* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  * Same as the first, seek out a third party mediator 
* How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  * Do our best to explain what's going on to the other person
